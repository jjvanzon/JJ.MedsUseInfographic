JJ.MedsUseInfographic
=====================

Introduction
------------
This is an attempt to plot some medication use of mine as an infographic using JJ.Framework.VectorGraphics.

With perhaps no other reasons than therapeutical, recreational, artistic expression. The point to it may be that there is no point to it.


Set Up Dev Environment
----------------------
* The solutions might only build if you clone another repository too: JJ.Framework. ([https://github.com/jjvanzon/JJ.Framework](https://github.com/jjvanzon/JJ.Framework))
* It should be cloned to a folder "..\JJs Software\JJ.Framwwork" relative to this folder.
* Sorry for the hassle.
* First you might build JJ.Framework.sln or at least NuGet-restore it.
* Then the solution in this repository may build.
