Introduction
------------
This is an attempt to plot some medication use of mine as an infographic using JJ.Framework.VectorGraphics.

With perhaps no other reasons than therapeutical, recreational, artistic expression. The point to it may be that there is no point to it. That's the point.


Set Up Dev Environment
----------------------
* Programmed with Visual Studio Community 2019.
* The solutions might only build when cloning another repository too: JJ.Framework. ([https://github.com/jjvanzon/JJ.Framework](https://github.com/jjvanzon/JJ.Framework))
* It should be cloned to a folder 'JJ.Framework' that would be right next to your 'JJ.SaveText' repository clone.
* First maybe build JJ.Framework.sln or perhaps NuGet-restoring it is enough.
* Then the solution in this repository may build.
