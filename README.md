Introduction
------------

This is an attempt to plot some medication use of mine as an infographic using JJ.Framework.VectorGraphics.

With perhaps no other reasons than therapeutical, recreational, artistic expression. The point to it may be that there is no point to it. That's the point.


Setting Up Dev Environment
--------------------------

### Visual Studio

- Programmed with Visual Studio Community 2019.

### JJ.Framework

- Pre-release versions of *JJ.Framework* components may be used.
- They might be hosted in *Azure DevOps*: https://dev.azure.com/jjvanzon/JJs%20Software/_packaging?_a=feed&feed=JJs-Pre-Release-Package-Feed
- They may require configuring *NuGet* to connect to an additional package source.
- The following info might be useful for that:
- *Name:* JJs-Pre-Release-Package-Feed
- *Source:* https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/jjvanzon/1de16010-421a-41a5-90f1-86e9513f2c5b/_packaging/JJs-Pre-Release-Package-Feed/nuget/v3/index.json
