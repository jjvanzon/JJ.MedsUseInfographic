Introduction
------------

This is an attempt to plot some medication use of mine as an infographic using JJ.Framework.VectorGraphics.

With perhaps no other reasons than therapeutical, recreational, artistic expression. The point to it may be that there is no point to it. That's the point.


Set Up Dev Environment
----------------------

- Programmed with Visual Studio Community 2019.

- This project may use pre-release versions of JJ.Framework components.
- This may desire NuGet to be configured to connect to JJs-Pre-Release-Package-Feed, for which the following information might be used:
    - Name: JJs-Pre-Release-Package-Feed
    - Source: https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/jjvanzon/1de16010-421a-41a5-90f1-86e9513f2c5b/_packaging/JJs-Pre-Release-Package-Feed/nuget/v3/index.json
- Then the solution in this repository may build.
